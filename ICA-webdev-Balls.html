    <h1 id="heads">How does the ball affect the reaction on the lane?</h1>
    <p id="ballintro">Well, there are 4 different ways that a ball can affect the performance down the lane. They are the <a href="#coverstocks">coverstock</a>, <a href="#Surface">surface</a>, <a href="#Core">core</a> and <a href="#layout">layout</a>. All of them affects the ball in some way and makes each ball <span class="highlights">similar but never the same</span>. Some bowling balls have more use than others, but every ball has its time to shine.</p>
    <h2 id="coverstock">Coverstocks</h2>
    <p id="coverstockpara">A coverstock is you think it is, the cover of the bowling ball. There are 3 main genres of coverstocks in bowling, reactive, urethane and plastic coverstocks. Reactive coverstocks has 3 subcategories which will be covered later on. Here is a table that describes the differences between the different main coverstocks.</p>

            <tr>

                <td>It is a very <span class="highlights">consistent ball</span> and <span class="highlights">easy to control</span>, used for dry or short patterns.</td>
                <td>Mostly used for <a href="ICA-webdev-home.html#spare">spares</a> as it can be <span class="highlights">easily controlled to shoot straight</span> to the pins.</td>

                <td>The cheapest of the 3, mostly bought by beginners in a starter's kit.</td>

                    <td>Is a <span class="highlights">mixture</span> of pearl and solid, and usually is a <span class="highlights">ratio of pearl to solid</span>. (e.g. Storm Hyroad)</td>
                    <td>Pearls are the <span class="highlights">strongest</span> of the 3, most of the time is very <a href="#Surface">shiny</a>. (e.g. 900 Global Eternity)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>Throw on when the lanes have <span class="highlights">just been reoiled</span>, or on patterns with <span class="highlights">light oil</span>. Solids hook the <span class="highlights">earliest</span> of the reactive coverstocks</td>
                    <td>Usually thrown around when the lanes <span class="highlights">start to transition</span>, or on <span class="highlights">heavier</span> oil patterns than solids.

                    <td>Used on the <span class="highlights">later parts of the day</span>, when the oil pattern has been <span class="highlights">heavily used</span>, or on patterns with <span class="highlights">more oil</span>. Hooks the <span class="highlights">latest</span> with a <span class="highlights">sharp motion at the end</span></td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        <div class="body">
        <h2 id="Surface">Surface</h2>
        <p id="surfaceexp">Now that we have talked about the coverstocks, we will talk about surface. Basically surface is the <span class="highlights">polish</span> of the bowling ball; how <span class="highlights">shiny/dull</span> it is. Having a <span class="highlights">shiny ball</span> means that the ball will hook <span class="highlights">later</span>, while <span class="highlights">dull balls</span> hook <span class="highlights">earlier.</span></p>
        <p id="SDPS">So usually when a ball is mass produced, the <span class="highlights">finish</span> of the ball will be the <span class="highlights">exact same</span>. This is called the <span class="highlights">factory finish</span>. Surfaces can then be modified by using an <span class="highlights">abralon pad</span>. To apply surface on a ball, <span class="highlights">clean</span> the ball, then rub the abralon pad in a <span class="highlights">circular motion</span> evenly around the ball.</p>
        <img src="abralonpad.jpg" alt="">
        <p id="caption">Abralon pads</p>
        <p>Abralon pads come in many grit rating, ranging from <span class="highlights">180-4000</span>. However the more popular options are 500, 1000 and 2000. Most professionals <span class="highlights">depend on abralon pads during competitions</span>, as most competitions only allow a <span class="highlights">limited amount</span> of bowling balls in the arsenal
            . This means that the only way they can help their ball hook more/less is to use abralon pads.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Core">Core</h2>
        <p id="coreexp">A bowling ball core is what is <span class="highlights">inside</span> a bowling ball and it is the <span class="highlights">heaviest part</span> of the ball. It is often called a <span class="highlights">weight block</span>. A bowling ball core is made of powdered metal oxides mixed with resin and a catalyst. A core determines how a ball will <span class="highlights">roll and rotate down the lane</span>. While the lane surface and oil pattern will also contribute to ball motion, the core is probably the most <span class="highlights">significant factor to consider</span> when purchasing a new bowling ball. 
            A core can be <span class="highlights">symmetrical like a sphere</span>, or <span class="highlights">asymmetrical like a lightbulb</span>,  which influences how the ball <span class="highlights">rotates down the lane</span>. This influence can determine a bowler's performance.
        </p>
        <img src="sym+asymm.png" alt="">
        <p id="caption">example of symmetrical core and asymmetrical core</p>
        <h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
        <p id="layoutexp">The layout is where your <span class="highlights">fingerholes</span> are drilled on the ball, and affects where the <span class="highlights">core will be when thrown</span>, thus can affect the <span class="highlights">reaction of the ball</span> on the lane, especially with asymmetric balls, as where you drill affects how the core will be rolling down the lane. For <span class="highlights">beginners</span>, layouts would not matter as much as your <span class="highlights">form</span> will change <span class="highlights">over time.</span>
             The most important thing about layout is the <span class="highlights">span</span>(Your bowling ball span is the measured distance between the placement of the gripping holes used to hold the ball. The span refers commonly to the distance from the front edge of the drilled thumb gripping hole to the front edges of the two finger gripping holes), as having a span <span class="highlights">too long or too short</span> can affect your <span class="highlights">release and form badly.</span></p>
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p id="end">So basically, buying a bowling ball is something that people would do if they want to start to try taking bowling as a <span class="highlights">more serious sport(+shoes for sliding and more consistency)</span>. Ones style may vary based on personal preference, so don't try to bowl like other people, or use the balls they use and just bowl <span class="highlights">freely and enjoy the game!</span></p>
